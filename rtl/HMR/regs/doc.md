The basic structure of a register definition file is thus:

```hjson
{
  name: "GP",
  regwidth: "32",
  registers: [
    // register definitions...
  ]
}

```



The list of registers includes register definition groups containing the following keys:

Key | Kind | Type | Description of Value
--- | ---- | ---- | --------------------
name | required | string | name of the register
desc | required | text | description of the register
fields | required | list | list of register field description groups
swaccess | optional | string | software access permission to use for fields that don't specify swaccess
hwaccess | optional | string | hardware access permission to use for fields that don't specify hwaccess
hwext | optional | string | 'true' if the register is stored outside of the register module
hwqe | optional | string | 'true' if hardware uses 'q' enable signal, which is latched signal of software write pulse.
hwre | optional | string | 'true' if hardware uses 're' signal, which is latched signal of software read pulse.
regwen | optional | string | if register is write-protected by another register, that register name should be given here. empty-string for no register write protection
resval | optional | int | reset value of full register (default 0)
tags | optional | string | tags for the register, following the format 'tag_name:item1:item2...'
shadowed | optional | string | 'true' if the register is shadowed
update_err_alert | optional | string | alert that will be triggered if this shadowed register has update error
storage_err_alert | optional | string | alert that will be triggered if this shadowed register has storage error


The basic register definition group will follow this pattern:

```hjson
    { name: "REGA",
      desc: "Description of register",
      swaccess: "rw",
      resval: "42",
      fields: [
        // bit field definitions...
      ]
    }
```

The name and brief description are required. If the swaccess key is
provided it describes the access pattern that will be used by all
bitfields in the register that do not override with their own swaccess
key. This is a useful shortcut because in most cases a register will
have the same access restrictions for all fields. The reset value of
the register may also be provided here or in the individual fields. If
it is provided in both places then they must match, if it is provided
in neither place then the reset value defaults to zero for all except
write-only fields when it defaults to x.



In the fields list each field definition is a group itself containing the following keys:

Key | Kind | Type | Description of Value
--- | ---- | ---- | --------------------
bits | required | bitrange | bit or bit range (msb:lsb)
name | optional | string | name of the field
desc | optional | text | description of field (required if the field has a name)
swaccess | optional | string | software access permission, copied from register if not provided in field. (Tool adds if not provided.)
hwaccess | optional | string | hardware access permission, copied from register if not prvided in field. (Tool adds if not provided.)
resval | optional | xint | reset value, comes from register resval if not provided in field. Zero if neither are provided and the field is readable, x if neither are provided and the field is wo. Must match if both are provided.
enum | optional | list | list of permitted enumeration groups
tags | optional | string | tags for the field, followed by the format 'tag_name:item1:item2...'


Field names should be relatively short because they will be used
frequently (and need to fit in the register layout picture!) The field
description is expected to be longer and will most likely make use of
the Hjson ability to include multi-line strings. An example with three
fields:

```hjson
    fields: [
      { bits: "15:0",
        name: "RXS",
        desc: '''
        Last 16 oversampled values of RX. These are captured at 16x the baud
        rate clock. This is a shift register with the most recent bit in
        bit 0 and the oldest in bit 15. Only valid when ENRXS is set.
        '''
      }
      { bits: "16",
        name: "ENRXS",
        desc: '''
          If this bit is set the receive oversampled data is collected
          in the RXS field.
        '''
      }
      {bits: "20:19", name: "TXILVL",
       desc: "Trigger level for TX interrupts",
       resval: "2",
       enum: [
               { value: "0", name: "txlvl1", desc: "1 character" },
               { value: "1", name: "txlvl4", desc: "4 characters" },
               { value: "2", name: "txlvl8", desc: "8 characters" },
               { value: "3", name: "txlvl16", desc: "16 characters" }
             ]
      }
    ]
```

In all of these the swaccess parameter is inherited from the register
level, and will be added so this key is always available to the
backend. The RXS and ENRXS will default to zero reset value (unless
something different is provided for the register) and will have the
key added, but TXILVL expicitly sets its reset value as 2.

The missing bits 17 and 18 will be treated as reserved by the tool, as
will any bits between 21 and the maximum in the register.

The TXILVL is an example using an enumeration to specify all valid
values for the field. In this case all possible values are described,
if the list is incomplete then the field is marked with the rsvdenum
key so the backend can take appropriate action. (If the enum field is
more than 7 bits then the checking is not done.)



Definitions in an enumeration group contain:

Key | Kind | Type | Description of Value
--- | ---- | ---- | --------------------
name | required | string | name of the member of the enum
desc | required | text | description when field has this value
value | required | int | value of this member of the enum


The list of registers may include single entry groups to control the offset, open a window or generate registers:

Key | Kind | Type | Description of Value
--- | ---- | ---- | --------------------
reserved | optional | int | number of registers to reserve space for
skipto | optional | int | set next register offset to value
window | optional | group | group defining an address range for something other than standard registers
multireg | optional | group | group defining registers generated from a base instance.




Registers can protect themselves from software writes by using the
register attribute regwen. When not an emptry string (the default
value), regwen indicates that another register must be true in order
to allow writes to this register.  This is useful for the prevention
of software modification.  The register-enable register (call it
REGWEN) must be one bit in width, and should default to 1 and be rw1c
for preferred security control.  This allows all writes to proceed
until at some point software disables future modifications by clearing
REGWEN. An error is reported if REGWEN does not exist, contains more
than one bit, is not `rw1c` or does not default to 1. One REGWEN can
protect multiple registers. The REGWEN register must precede those
registers that refer to it in the .hjson register list. An example:

```hjson
    { name: "REGWEN",
      desc: "Register write enable for a bank of registers",
      swaccess: "rw1c",
      fields: [ { bits: "0", resval: "1" } ]
    }
    { name: "REGA",
      swaccess: "rw",
      regwen: "REGWEN",
      ...
    }
    { name: "REGB",
      swaccess: "rw",
      regwen: "REGWEN",
      ...
    }
```


A window defines an open region of the register space that can be used
for things that are not registers (for example access to a buffer ram).


Key | Kind | Type | Description of Value
--- | ---- | ---- | --------------------
name | required | string | name of the window
desc | required | text | description of the window
items | required | int | size in fieldaccess width words of the window
swaccess | required | string | software access permitted
data-intg-passthru | optional | string | True if the window has data integrity pass through. Defaults to false if not present.
byte-write | optional | string | True if byte writes are supported. Defaults to false if not present.
validbits | optional | int | Number of valid data bits within regwidth sized word. Defaults to regwidth. If smaller than the regwidth then in each word of the window bits [regwidth-1:validbits] are unused and bits [validbits-1:0] are valid.
unusual | optional | string | True if window has unusual parameters (set to prevent Unusual: errors).Defaults to false if not present.


The multireg expands on the register required fields and will generate
a list of the generated registers (that contain all required and
generated keys for an actual register).


Key | Kind | Type | Description of Value
--- | ---- | ---- | --------------------

hwqe | optional | string | 'true' if hardware uses 'q' enable signal, which is latched signal of software write pulse.
hwre | optional | string | 'true' if hardware uses 're' signal, which is latched signal of software read pulse.
regwen | optional | string | if register is write-protected by another register, that register name should be given here. empty-string for no register write protection
resval | optional | int | reset value of full register (default 0)
